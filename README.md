# mandate

This project was created with [Better-T-Stack](https://github.com/AmanVarshney01/create-better-t-stack), a modern TypeScript stack that combines Next.js, Hono, TRPC, and more.

## Features

- **TypeScript** - For type safety and improved developer experience
- **Next.js** - Full-stack React framework
- **React Native** - Build mobile apps using React
- **Expo** - Tools for React Native development
- **TailwindCSS** - Utility-first CSS for rapid UI development
- **Shared UI package** - shadcn/ui primitives live in `packages/ui`
- **Hono** - Lightweight, performant server framework
- **tRPC** - End-to-end type-safe APIs
- **Node.js** - Runtime environment
- **Mongoose** - TypeScript-first ORM
- **MongoDB** - Database engine
- **Authentication** - Better-Auth
- **Turborepo** - Optimized monorepo build system

## Getting Started

First, install the dependencies:

```bash
pnpm install
```

## Database Setup

This project uses MongoDB with Mongoose.

1. Make sure you have MongoDB set up.
2. Update your `apps/server/.env` file with your MongoDB connection URI.

Then, run the development server:

```bash
pnpm run dev
```

Open [http://localhost:3001](http://localhost:3001) in your browser to see the web application.
From `apps/native`, run the `ios` script for iOS or the `android` script for Android to build and launch the app. See [Expo development builds](https://docs.expo.dev/develop/development-builds/introduction/) for device setup.
The API is running at [http://localhost:3000](http://localhost:3000).

## UI Customization

React web apps in this stack share shadcn/ui primitives through `packages/ui`.

- Change design tokens and global styles in `packages/ui/src/styles/globals.css`
- Update shared primitives in `packages/ui/src/components/*`
- Adjust shadcn aliases or style config in `packages/ui/components.json` and `apps/web/components.json`

### Add more shared components

Run this from the project root to add more primitives to the shared UI package:

```bash
npx shadcn@latest add accordion dialog popover sheet table -c packages/ui
```

Import shared components like this:

```tsx
import { Button } from "@mandate/ui/components/button";
```

### Add app-specific blocks

If you want to add app-specific blocks instead of shared primitives, run the shadcn CLI from `apps/web`.

## Environment Configuration

Each app owns its environment schema in `.env.schema`. Varlock generates `src/env.ts` during installation; run `pnpm run env:generate` after changing a schema. Commit schemas, and keep secrets in ignored env files or your deployment platform.

Import the generated `ENV` accessor in application code. Shared database and auth packages receive configuration or initialized clients from the application. See [Varlock's monorepo guide](https://varlock.dev/guides/monorepos/).

Bun's automatic env loading is disabled in `bunfig.toml`; the framework integration or server bootstrap loads Varlock. Node deployments must include Varlock and its dependencies alongside the app schema.

Run standalone Node/Bun tools that use Varlock from the owning app directory so they load that app's schema and env files. `env:generate` only generates TypeScript files; it does not initialize environment values in a subsequent command.

The server also requires `INTENT_SIGNING_KEY` (at least 32 characters). Keep this key stable: confirmed policy signatures cannot be verified after changing it.

## Policy Compiler

The authenticated tRPC mutations `rules.preview` and `rules.confirm` accept policy text and an existing store ID. Preview returns validated rules, including the store's PayPal merchant ID and an explicit `recipientMustBe: "store"` constraint; confirmation checks that preview again, creates a versioned policy, and signs an intent record. `rules.verifyIntent` checks the stored signature. The current MVP interpreter supports a constrained format such as “Groceries up to $80 a week. Ask me before anything over $30 from a new category. Never gift cards or subscriptions.” Supported category names are groceries, books, clothing, electronics, gift cards, and subscriptions. Unsupported wording is rejected for the shopper to revise. These endpoints do not authorize payments.

Run compiler and signature tests with `pnpm --filter @mandate/api test` and `pnpm --filter server test`. For database-backed endpoint tests, start MongoDB and run `MANDATE_TEST_MONGODB_URI=mongodb://127.0.0.1:27017 pnpm --filter server test:integration`. The test suite creates and removes its own randomly named database.
